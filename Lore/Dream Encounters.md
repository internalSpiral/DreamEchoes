Mazari's narcolepsy is linked to her bond with Soul. She experiences vivid dreams where she fights against dream predators that feed on memory and identity. The deeper she falls into the The Dream Realm the more intense the encounters become. 

Mazari initially set out on her mission to enter deeper into the dream realm to save Soul, who is currently imprisoned in The Dreaming Tree. **Soul** was once a great guardian spirit â€” until he was _tricked_ and _chained_ to the **Dreaming Tree** as a **warden-slave**, his power siphoned to keep these predators at bay.

The Dreaming Tree is located deep in the heart of the Dreaming plane, making it almost impossible for Mazari to reach Soul's physical form without succumbing to the dream predators.
