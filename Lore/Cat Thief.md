At first, it was difficult trying to survive all on her own. With only Soul to rely on, the Mazari would often use her illusionary tricks to survive-- shapeshifting into an unassuming cat and swiping scraps. As she grew older, however, as she was doing her usual routine around the marketplace, a peculiar white-haired boy walks up to her, still in feline form. He offers her food, and, startled by the snake that pops out of his scarf, she abruptly breaks the illusion; causing her to stumble back on the ground with a dumbfounded look. The was her first encounter with Asra, who had suspected that the cat was a girl this whole time. When asked about where she learned such intriguing magic, Mazari could not give them a clear answer; as she could not remember herself. This was because Mazari's memories were a completely blank state; willingly giving over her memories to Soul so she could forget about her bloody past. At that, Asra was surprised, as it reminded him very much of a certain friend of his. Before they could speak further, Mazari shapeshifts into a cat again after a few officials were about to pass by them; disappearing into the crowd once more.
