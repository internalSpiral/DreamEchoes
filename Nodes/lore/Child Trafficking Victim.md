Born to a seemingly normal family in a small village, Mazari  and Cassian were eventually taken away from their family by raiders who sold them to a dark noble who was called Lord Morgrave. Since their parents couldn't do anything to stop the raiders from plundering the village, they were forced to give up their two children to them. The family was split up from the chaos, with their parents being dragged away somewhere else. Mazari never knew of what became of them.

While Mazari saw this as a horrifying event that would change their lives forever, Cassian was... different, who always saw his life back at the village as mundane and too repetitive. He had always believed he was destined for something greater than just living a boring village life like their parents were too content on doing... At least, that was what he told himself, and to Mazari, as their fates were held in the palm of their captors' hands. Maybe this new life of theirs wouldn't be so bad?

It turns out that he was wrong.

A disgraced noble turned underground warlord, Lord Morgrave vanished from court life after being accused of black magic, human trafficking, and assassinations tied to political purges. With a hidden estate far from the eyes of the crown, he began “collecting” children during raids—orphans, stolen heirs, or simply the forgotten—molding them into a secret army of spies and killers.
