After bonding with her ancient familiar, Soul, Mazari has the peculiar ability to enter The Dream Realm; a strange realm where nothing makes much sense. Time is erratic there, varying greatly from the real world. Sometimes time passes in minutes, days, or even a whole month. This explains why Mazari can be a little forgetful sometimes; she was literally gone for who knows how long.

She also has the peculiar ability to pacify/calm people down, or even help them have restful sleeps by manipulating their dreams. She can see if someone is going through a nightmare, and may choose to intervene. This, however, has some detrimental effects to her own health if she isnâ€™t careful. In a way, Mazari can hop into someoneâ€™s state of mind via dream portals.

Emotional Manipulation. Not in a psychological sense, but Mazari can magically â€˜tweakâ€™ how someone is feeling with subtle dream magic. Since her powers are inherently linked to the mind, she can â€˜influenceâ€™ what the person feels. Her azure eyes, which usually have spirals instead of pupils, would swirl around hypnotically when sheâ€™s casting this sort of magic; giving her away. Thus, she only uses this scarcely, and only if sheâ€™s out of sight.
