Most likely to: Go MIA to take catnaps in the day, or magically fall asleep in the middle of a conversation (or during a fight, in worse case scenarios). Passive aggressively give someone the cold shoulder when she’s pissed at them
Other???: Cannot be awoken normally when in magical slumber. Has prophetic dreams but at the cost of some of her memories. There is more that goes on in her dreams, and time is vastly different and may greatly vary each time for each dream (time doesn’t make any sense in dreamland and is a bad omen).

### **Physical Appearance:**
A dainty, slender young woman with fair skin, long black hair, and greyish-blue eyes. There is a black little beauty mark underneath each eye, and her eyes have a concentric ring pattern instead of pupils. 

> *“Her eyes shimmered with a concentric ring pattern, each layer glowing like ripples in moonlit water.”

Prefers to wear cold palettes, with lots of purples and blues. Stands at a humble 5’1” ft. Gets easily missed in a room full of people because of it.

Her sense of style is more on the comfy side, prioritizing coziness over presentation. She doesn’t much care about fussing over ‘looking the best’, but does value practicality in her outfits. Since she magically falls asleep at the most awkward moments, Kyren tries to avoid flowy dresses and skirts when she can, but is very partial to soft robes.

Kyren’s signature scent would most likely smell like a mixture of lavender, vanilla, and a hint of the ocean breeze.
### **Strengths:**
- Calm, soothing presence (almost hypnotic)\
- Deeply observant and sharp despite appearance
- Skilled listener; picks up on subtle details
- Artistic; uses Fine Arts to preserve memories and self-identity
- Even-tempered, kind, rarely reactive
###  **Weaknesses:**
- Under a magical sleep condition that is similar to Narcolepsy; perpetually tired, physically unreliable
- Conflict-avoidant; runs from problems, worsens situations
- Self-isolating out of guilt; distances from loved ones
- Struggles with feeling like a burden
- Susceptible to memory loss from Dreamscape exposure
- Insecure about her constant absence and dissociation
### **Other notes:**
- People often underestimate her due to her dreamy, detached vibe
- Internalized self-hatred over her "brokenness"
- Sharp insight can unnerve others due to unexpected bluntness
- Heavy fear of forgetting herself and the people she loves
### **Summary:** 
Perpetually tired due to her narcolepsy and is nice to everyone. Always soft-spoken and fairly even-tempered. Flaw-wise, this makes her seem naïve and easily exploitable. Her desire for peace and avoiding confrontation also makes her somewhat hard to talk to, as she distances herself from conflict instead of facing things head on, her tendency to run from her problems only making things ironically even worse than it is.

Exudes a calm and almost dreamy aura, like she’s still trapped in a dream-like haze. Might make you drowsy. Because of this, people often mistake her for being lazy and underestimate the young girl a lot. Constantly wears a ‘has her head stuck in the clouds’ expression, and gets tired easily. She hates that she sleeps so much, as it makes her feel broken.

While known for her inherent kindness and tranquility, she is not known to keep others close and distances herself often, mostly out of guilt. Since she spends so much of her time in the dreamscape, Kyren often feels out of the loop in reality and isn’t doing as much for her loved ones—at least, as much as she should. Because of this, she withdraws in on herself. Not out of coldness, but out of quiet belief that her presence is more of a burden than a comfort.

People are often caught off guard by the sleepy girl’s sharp insight. Her perceptiveness stems from a quiet insecurity—she’s rarely fully present, often drifting through the deep recesses of her mind or lost in the Dreaming Plane. To compensate for her frequent absences, she’s learned to observe the small, easily missed details in others, becoming an unexpectedly skilled listener. This duality makes her hard to read; one moment she’s drowsy and distant, the next she’s cutting straight to the heart of something with unnerving clarity.

Kyren is a Fine Arts girlie and loves to paint. It helps her express the thoughts she’s too afraid to voice out, but most importantly, it helps her remember. Traversing the dreamscape makes her susceptible to memory loss. This makes her hyper fixate on solidifying her memories, collecting them all in one timeless piece. She’s afraid of the possibility that she may forget her loved ones; forget even her own self, seeing only a stranger looking back at her in the mirror.
