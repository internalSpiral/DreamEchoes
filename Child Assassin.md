Mazari was initially raised to become a ruthless, mindless assassin.

Raised in a brutal, elite household where children were trained to kill from a young age. She was only 7 years old at the time. Mazari's exceptional illusion magic made her valuable, especially for infiltration, but she always feared and hated killing, making her seen as weak and a defect.

Knowing of Mazari's frailness and aversion to violence, Cassian, her older brother, shielded her from the brunt of their household's punishments, hoping that she would toughen up later on in her own time.
