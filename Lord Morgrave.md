*Aka the bastard that gave the Harlow siblings trauma™*

**Sevrin Morgrave**, a disgraced noble turned underground warlord, vanished from court life after being accused of black magic, human trafficking, and assassinations tied to political purges. With a hidden estate far from the eyes of the crown, he began “collecting” children during raids—orphans, stolen heirs, or simply the forgotten—molding them into a secret army of spies and killers.

He believes loyalty is built through erasure:
- Strips each child of their name, past, and personal identity.
- Trains them through psychological torture, magical conditioning, and combat indoctrination.
- Enforces a strict hierarchy: only the ruthless rise, the weak are disposed of or turned into tools.
    

**His Modus Operandi:**
- Children are turned into living illusions—assassins who can shift appearance, impersonate nobles, seduce targets, or quietly eliminate threats.
- Uses cursed objects to bind their obedience (rings, collars, brands, etc.)
- Especially fascinated by "unique traits"—illusionists, dreamwalkers, blood mages. That’s why Mazari’s magic marked her as high-value, and why Soul’s appearance sealed her fate.
- 
His relationship with Cassian and Mazari are as follows:
- Saw Cassian's ambition and rewarded it with faster promotions and harsher tasks.
- Saw Mazari's hesitance as a flaw—but her illusion magic was too valuable to discard.
- Pitted them against each other: Cassian favored, Mazari tested. This drove the wedge between the siblings.
- Was obsessed with breaking Mazari’s spirit to mold her into a perfect spy. Her bond with Soul was the one thing he couldn’t control.
