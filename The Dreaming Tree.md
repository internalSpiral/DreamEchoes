### **When Mazari Dreamed Too Deep**

At fifteen, Mazari was given three days of rest, a rare reward after successful assignments. During this time, she wandered, ending up in a strange, forgotten forest filled with tall, silent trees and a hum of ancient energy. Exhausted, she fell asleep under an old tree, but when she closed her eyes, she found herself in a different realmâ€”The Dream Realm. In this realm, she encountered a small, silver-scaled creature swimming through the air like water. The creature introduced itself as Soul. Soul was a guardian from another plane, weak and bound to the cracks between dream and death. Mazari, by falling so deep into sleep, became a doorway for Soul. When she awoke, Soul was in her lap, bound to her, and from that moment, Mazariâ€™s sleep was never the same. Her narcolepsy began, with her collapsing unexpectedly due to the strain of the bond. Every emotional trigger or magical overuse would pull her into the Dreaming Plane, where Soul guided her. Her narcolepsy was misinterpreted by others as a curse or defect, but Cassian knew the truth, though he resented it. Soul, invisible to the outside world, became her secret companion and gatekeeper, teaching her hidden magic and the mysteries of the Dreaming Plane. However, the deeper Mazari went into the dream world, the more her waking life suffered. Soul promised to bring her back whenever she fell too deep, but Mazari was slipping closer and closer to something unknown.

**Long ago**, before kingdoms rose and fell, there stood a tree older than stone â€” the Dreaming Tree. Its roots ran deep into the Dreaming Plane, the hidden world where all dreams are spun and born. It was said to be a bridge between waking and sleeping, between the mortal world and the unseen tides of memory.

Soul, once a mighty warden of dreams â€” a serpent of mist and tide â€” was tasked with guarding the rift between dreams and nightmares. But mankind grew arrogant. **A cabal of magicians**, fearing Soulâ€™s power to turn dreams against them, wove a betrayal: they sealed him into the Dreaming Tree using ancient, forgotten rites. His body was trapped between worlds, **shrinking**, **weakening**, **fading** with each passing century as no dreamer came close enough to hear his call.

The magic of the tree acted like a **cage**. It fed off the dreams of mortals who wandered near, keeping Soul barely alive but **leeching his strength**. Over time, he became **small**, **fragile**, **fading into a whisper** lost among the humming roots.

Until **Mazari**.

One day, a child assassin scouting the woods, battered and exhausted, dared to **sleep beneath the Dreaming Tree**. Where others passed by blind, Mazari â€” with her bruised, battered soul â€” **listened** without knowing. Her mind cracked open the door.

**Her sleep became the key.**  
**Her spirit became the bridge.**

When Mazari dozed, she fell through the cracks of the world into the Dreaming Plane. There, **Soul** â€” now no bigger than a handspan, a silver ripple in the dark â€” found her.  
To survive, he needed an **anchor**: a living soul strong enough to carry his presence out of the dying tree.  
To escape, he needed **trust** â€” something rare and precious among the broken children of the world.

Mazari, half out of kindness and half out of forgotten instinct, **accepted him without fear**.  
The bond was sealed.

From that day, **Mazari carried Soulâ€™s spirit inside her dreams**, and Soul, in return, **guarded her sleeping mind** from the predators of the Dreaming Plane â€” but at the cost of her waking strength.  
Their fates were **twisted together**: her narcolepsy, his freedom, their survival.

**Some say** that if Mazari ever falls too deep into the Dream again without Soul to guide her back, she would become like the old Dreaming Tree herself: a hollow shell, humming forgotten songs to a world that never stops to listen.
