#relationships [[Mazari]]

Mazari’s familiar is a draconic dream warden named Soul, an ancient sentinel that once guarded a sacred tree. Appearance-wise, he looks like a dragon serpent with antlers instead of horns. He doesn’t have a physical form; instead, he walks between the spirit realm and reality as a spectral spirit. Soul can’t communicate as humans do. Instead, he projects his emotions telepathically and makes a few spectral dragon noises if necessary. Soul provides Mazari with protection in the Dreaming Plane, but also contributes to her narcolepsy, which makes her vulnerable to dream predators. Mazari perpetually gives some of her energy over to Soul to keep him alive, which is why she's always tired.

As a specter, Soul can vanish at will and shapeshift, a convenient way for him to hide while accompanying Mazari on her travels. However, Soul is quite a playful spirit and loves messing with people, may that be through innocent pranks or passing through them. He loves hiding inside Mazari’s sleeves or resting on her shoulders. Soul’s size can vary depending on his mood, but takes on a smaller, unnoticeable size around large crowds.

### **Soul Manifests a Physical Form**

Dilemma: When Mazari first bonded with Soul, he was nothing but a ghost of himself—literally. Smaller and disconnected from the home he used to live in; an ancient, magical tree.

Conclusion: After the ancient tree was healed from its blight, Soul is freed from the Spiritual Realm. Before, Soul was like a branch that was severed from its tree. Now, he has gained full control of his dream magic once more; enabling him to walk between both realms freely.
