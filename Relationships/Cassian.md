Mazari's older brother, who was trained as an assassin with her. He resents Mazari for choosing to bond with Soul, which he sees as a betrayal. Their relationship is strained due to past events and Mazari's departure at age 16. 

**Cassian**, her older brother, resented Mazari for bonding with Soul, whom he considered a cursed creature; blaming him for Mazari‚Äôs narcoleptic condition. Their relationship became strained, especially after Mazari froze during her first mission kill at age 12, and Cassian was forced to do it for her. At age 16, Mazari grew weary of the bloodshed and decided to leave her assassin life behind. Knowing that Cassian would never approve of her decision, she vanished without telling Cassian, taking on a completely new face and fleeing to Vesuvia.

Mazari and Cassian are mirrors of each other‚Äôs suffering, distorted reflections shaped by the same trauma but split by how they chose to survive it. Where Mazari fled‚Äîseeking escape, softness, and distance from the violence that stole their childhood‚ÄîCassian hardened, embracing brutality as a shield and identity. Both carry the same wounds of abandonment, powerlessness, and guilt, but each buried them differently: Mazari through retreat and dissociation, Cassian through control and domination. Their bond is poisoned by resentment and silent grief, each mistaking the other‚Äôs coping for betrayal. Until they confront the root of their shared trauma‚Äîthe original wound that enslaved them‚Äîthey will remain trapped in an endless cycle of pain, miscommunication, and estrangement, each blaming themselves and each other for scars they were too young to prevent. Healing can only come when they stop seeing each other as the enemy and recognize the mirror between them.

## Trauma - Internalized Abuser

Cassian is the embodiment of an internalized abuser‚Äîhis core wounds rooted in betrayal, a warped superiority complex, and deep survivor‚Äôs guilt. He has developed a cold moral detachment, justifying horrific acts as necessary evils in the name of survival and order. Power, to him, is the only shield against chaos, which fuels his ruthless ambition and need for control in all relationships. His resentment toward Mazari runs deep: he envies her retained innocence and loathes her for what he sees as weakness‚Äîher refusal to adapt, to become what he did. Unable to express grief or vulnerability, Cassian suppresses emotion entirely, replacing it with anger, cruelty, and dominance. Underneath his pride lies a buried shame; he no longer sees himself as a person, but as a tool forged by others. The role of ‚Äúweapon‚Äù gave him identity when everything else was stripped away. To Cassian, compassion is weakness, healing is a lie, and love‚Äîtwisted by control‚Äîis the only form he knows. He resents Mazari for escaping the system that shaped them, while he remained and became it.
