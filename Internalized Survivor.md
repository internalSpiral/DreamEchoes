Mazari is the embodiment of an internalized survivor—her core wounds rooted in powerlessness, guilt, and abandonment. Her narcolepsy serves as both a literal condition and a **metaphor for chronic dissociation**, a way her mind escapes the lingering weight of trauma. Believing her presence to be more of a burden than a comfort, she isolates herself, convinced she does more harm than good. This results in hyper-observant behavior, a way to compensate for her emotional absences and internal disconnection. Her compulsive kindness is a trauma-driven fawn response, designed to keep conflict at bay—because confrontation, to her, means risk, pain, and failure. She clings to painting with near desperation, using it to preserve identity and memory in fear that she'll lose both to the dreamscape or to herself. Underneath it all, Mazari wrestles with impostor syndrome, convinced she’s broken, undeserving of peace, and incapable of true belonging. While sleep is her safest place, it’s also her most feared one—where the boundaries blur between self and shadow. She avoids leadership or responsibility, not from a lack of ability, but from the gnawing fear that she will fail those who depend on her, just as she feels she has failed before.
