[[Mazari]]            
- **Age 0–5**:
    
    - The Harlow siblings, Mazari and Cassian, were trafficked and taken into Lord Morgrave's household.
    - Groomed for obedience, loyalty, and utility—no family, only function.
        
- **Age 6–8:
    
    - Training intensifies. Mazari shows talent in illusion magic. Cassian excels in physical combat and leadership.
    - **Cassian** begins suppressing emotion to survive.
    - **Mazari** begins fawning—kindness as armor. They bond tightly, relying on each other silently.

- **Age 9-10**:
    
    - First mission assigned. A simple one, but required the death of one of Morgrave's enemies. It was to see if they were stealthy enough not to get caught.
    - Mazari freezes. Cassian kills for her.
    - **Cassian** begins resenting her weakness, even as he protects her.
    - **Mazari** feels shame and guilt, believes she’s a burden.
        
- **Age 11**:
    
    - For a year, Morgrave isolates and punishes Mazari for her "failures," viewing her as defective yet highly valuable. He ruthlessly attempts to mold her into the perfect spy, breaking her spirit piece by piece.
    - Cassian thrives under brutality, growing cold. Unlike Mazari, he’s quickly promoted and earns high praise. As he becomes more estranged from her, he’s indoctrinated, turning into a weapon. He believes strength is the only path to survival—kill or be killed—and tries to convince Mazari of the same.
    - Mazari only withdraws into herself more, dissociating as a way to cope. Soon discovers the dreamscape and meets Familiar, the serpent. Her narcolepsy begins.
        
- **Age 12**:
    
    - Mazari’s bond with Soul deepens, and she begins questioning her role. She escapes into the dreamscape, playing with Soul to briefly escape reality, only to be punished upon returning, lethargic. She sleeps more often. Cassian notices, sensing something is wrong. She becomes more carefree, spirited—still lethargic, but somehow rejuvenated. Mazari starts seeing the Dreamscape and Soul as the only place she can be her true self again—just a child.
    - Soul is the embodiment of hope in her eyes—a symbol of second chances. He shows her there’s more to the world, more to _life_, than bloodshed. Soul ignites the first glimmer of hope in her heart, as she dreams of one day escaping the hell they’re trapped in.
    - Cassian notices her distance and instability but refuses to acknowledge it.
    - Mazari starts hiding supplies and planning escape routes.
        
- **Age 13**:

    - Cassian finally notices she’s preparing to leave.
    - **Mazari begs Cassian to come with her.** They argue, their beliefs clashing—Mazari seeks peace, while Cassian clings to survival through control. Deep down, he fears the consequences of escape, but his pride deepens the rift between them. His need to protect them both was twisted by Morgrave, who fed him lies and stoked his fears.
    - Cassian **refuses**, fearing that all he’s worked for would be in vain. He can’t discard the blood, sweat, and tears he’s shed. Morgrave’s influence runs too deep, using Cassian’s status among the assassins as false security, convincing him that obedience and bloodshed are necessary for survival.
    - Cassian reveals Morgrave offered him a deal: get Mazari to submit, and they would be set apart, free from worry, with everything they ever dreamed of. If not, Morgrave would keep breaking Mazari until she obeys. No matter what they do, Morgrave will _always_ find a way to control them. Cassian chooses to fear Morgrave instead of choosing freedom with his sister.
    - Mazari ends up escaping alone. She leaves in the night, leaving behind her **sketchbook** filled with memories-- **drawings of them as children**, hiding under trees, sharing food, holding hands in fear.

    - Underneath the sketchbook reads:
    
    > "I’m sorry I couldn’t be what they wanted. I’m sorry I couldn’t be what you needed. But I’m going to find something better. For both of us. Even if I have to do it alone."

    - **Cassian finds it.** He tears that last page out and keeps it. **Lies to the guards** to protect her escape.
    - Cassian buries his feelings and doubles down on being Morgrave’s perfect weapon.
    - He resumes his missions, colder and sharper than ever—but the page stays with him, always.
        
- **Age 14**

    - Mazari is a little older now, but heartbroken. She decides to settle in Vesuvia, feeling lost and unaccustomed to her newfound independence, no longer having Cassian by her side. Seeing her in pain, Soul offers comfort. Mazari willingly entrusts her memories of the past to Soul, who safeguards them so she can start anew without the guilt constantly haunting her. Soul promises that, no matter what, those memories will remain locked unless absolutely necessary—a promise to leave the past behind forever, even Cassian.
    - Mazari’s first encounter with Asra is a bond formed over their shared affinity for magic and their status as orphans. Later, Asra introduces her to Muriel, another orphan, and the three become close, relying on each other through their youth.
    - For Mazari, she uses her illusionary magic to get by. She lives in the Vesuvian woods with Muriel and Asra, in a small little hut that they built for themselves. There, she practiced her shapeshifting skills under Soul's tutelage. Once she got the hang of it, she poses as a stray cat, stealing things in Vesuvia for their survival.
    - The Magician and Soul are absolute menaces and constantly prank their little proteges together.
        
        
- **Age 23 (Present Time aka current Arcana Timeline)**
    
    - As they get older, Asra and Mazari open a magic shop, marking the beginning of the Arcana's present timeline and setting the stage for the game's plot.
    - Meanwhile, Cassian remains Morgrave’s weapon—jaded, elite, and hollow.

    - ~~They argue bitterly—Mazari says he chose chains, Cassian says he was too broken to leave.~~
